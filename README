Hello, and welcome to my first published project on GitHub!

I'm still learning about the valuable tool that git is, and have decided to publish code here
in order to get some feedback, and see if there's any interest in it at all!

For now, this readme is really bad. I know, I'll improve it in time.


Keep in mind that this code is really bad, I know. Spare me the criticisim, that's why
I'm posting it here for improvement. This was a school project that I had created
by myself and was the first time I ever developed not only a game, but a project that required use
of network code.

Some changes I hope to make to the code are:

	* A dialog box that promps the user if they are a client/server
	* Fix New Game for not working properly
	* Graphics! I can't do Graphics!
	* Alerts, text alerts sometimes just aren't enough for the user who may not be
	paying attention!
	* ???
	
Thanks for checking out my project, feel free to fork it and abide by the License attached,
and I would appreciate any feedback, suggestions, comments, etc. Don't waste your time bashing me,
spare your fingers!

If you learned something from my project, great! I'm glad I was able to help you out!

Thanks!

-Benjamin Schellenberger
